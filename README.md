# Election Audit Summary

  The code developed for this analysis is an efficent tool to allow for situational adjustments.  This code is very scalable, and the 
  customization is easily expressed in the results with transparency.

  The code(file_to_load) allows for customization of the file location.  Data Source manipulation is extremely helpful when collaberating within a team.  
  Independent stakeholders can work on separate parts of a project, such as "Election Analysis"
